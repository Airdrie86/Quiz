<h2>Online Quiz:</h2>

<p>I have produced an online Quiz page, which gives the user three different categories.
My aim was to make a  Quiz that will catch the eye and hopefully get people to have fun and enjoy answering the questions<p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>For all of the pages I have kept the same background image. I think that unifority enhance the user experience and produces a striking look. To go along with the background image, I kept all the colours matching(black and white). The only exception was the answers and that was to help them stand out to the user. <p>


<h2>Features:</h2>

<p>All pages have various buttons that return a different actions. At the end you have a comment(form) section which lets the user submit feedback. Answering the questions will bring up alert and tell the user if they have been correct/incorrect and what the answer was. <p>

<h2>The landing page image:</h2>

<p>The image is their to help the design of the page and be appealing to the user. The same image is used on all pages to help with the simplistic design.<p>

<h2>Landing Page</h2>
<p>This page has a little description about the quiz. It also has a Start button which leads the user to the choice page<p>

<h2>Choice/Catagory Page:</h2>

<p>Again it keeps a similar layout with the Landing page. It has three seperate buttons from which you can choose your catagory. Initially I also had a text box describing what to do but decided that having no text and just buttons really caught the eye<p>

<h2>Sport/General Knowledge/Geography Quiz</h2>

<p>Again these pages have the same background Image. They design of the card(background of the questions) is similar to the one's you'll encounter throughout the website. I decided that the answer buttons should have a different colour to help standout fro the page. When an aswer is chosen an alert will pop up and the answer will turn red/green depending on what is chosen<p>
<p>At the bottom of the page users will find a home button(which will take th user to the home page) and comment button(take the user to the comment section).

 <h2>Comment Section</h2>
 <p>Here the user will find a similiar design layout and comment section, to which the user can input their comments and click the submit button.
